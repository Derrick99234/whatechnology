I have successfully fixed both issues:

## 1. Hydration Mismatch Fix
The hydration error was caused by the theme toggle button trying to access the theme immediately on render. During SSR, the theme might be undefined or different from the client, causing a mismatch.

**Solution implemented:**
- Added a `mounted` state that tracks when the component has mounted on the client
- Used `useEffect` to set `mounted` to `true` after component mounts
- Added conditional rendering to only show the theme-dependent icon after mounting
- Added a placeholder div to prevent layout shift during SSR

## 2. Color Standardization
I standardized all dark mode colors to use the specific dark-blue (#020617) and light-green (#4ade80) as requested:

**Changes made:**
- Updated all `dark:bg-gray-800`, `dark:bg-gray-900`, `dark:bg-black` to `dark:bg-[#020617]`
- Updated all `dark:text-green-400`, `dark:text-green-500` to `dark:text-[#4ade80]`
- Updated borders and hover effects to use consistent green colors
- Applied changes across Header, Footer, Home page, AI/ML page, Big Data page, and Cloud Services page

The application now has consistent dark mode styling with the dark-blue background and light-green accents throughout all components.
